MIC-MAQ for Microscopy Images of Cells - Multi Analyses and Quantifications is an ImageJ/Fiji Plugin for automatic segmentation of nuclei and/or cells for quantifications in other channels including foci detection 

- MIC-MAQ automatically segments cells and/or nuclei on 2D microscopy images 
- The plugin takes Z-stack but works only on 2D projection
- It provides intensity based and/or morphological measurements in nuclei and/or cells in multi channels experiment
- The plugin can propose the foci/spots detection
